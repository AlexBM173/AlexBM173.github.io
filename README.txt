Below are descriptions of the different files I am submitting. I have elected to use Python 3 to write my programs, and used the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, and math libraries. I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE, and GitHub for version tracking. Also required is the quasar.dat file for project 14.5.

14.5 Cosmological distances:

14_5_Cosmological_distances.pdf - Project report for 14.5 Cosmological distances. Important programs are included here as well in appendices.
II_CATAM_Cosmology_Q2.py - Python file for the numerical calculation of cosmological lookback times.
II_CATAM_Cosmology_Q4.py - Python file for the numerical calculation of various cosmological distance measures.
II_CATAM_Cosmology_Q6.py - Python file used to perform the luminosity-volume test on the quasar sample, as well as plot test data where required. This was altered slightly for question 7 (file not submitted) but remained largely identical.

23.5 Ionisation of the interstellar gas near a star:

23_5_Ionisation_of_the_interstellar_gas_near_a_star.pdf - Project report for 23.5 Ionisation of the interstellar gas near a star. Important programs are included here as well in appendices.
II_CATAM_Ionisation_Q2.py - Python file for the calculation and plotting of species number densities as functions of distance from the star.
II_CATAM_Ionisation_Q4.py - Python file for the approximate calculation of the Stomgren radius.
II_CATAM_Ionisation_Q5.py - Python file for the calculation and plotting of species number densities as functions of distance from the quasar. This file is quite similar to II_CATAM_Ionisation_Q2.py.
