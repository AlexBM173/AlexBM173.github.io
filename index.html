<p>
    I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this website at the moment. The plan at the moment is to document my life to an extent, mostly focusing on the academic side. I will upload academic resources I have made for my studies, projects, and anything I find intersting and worth sharing.
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p>
    I am a third-year (Part II) astrophysics undergraduate at the University of Cambridge. My main academic interests are in general relativity and cosmology. I have experience with programming in Python, and a touch of C++. I am currently taking courses in 
</p> 

<h3>Extracurricular</h3>
<h5>Sport</h5>
<p>
    I am a keen sportsman, having played many throughout my life, including 10 years of rugby. My main sports are athletics (discus, hammer, shot put) and weightlifting. My favourite sports to watch are Formula 1, football, international rugby, and athletics. I am currently the CU Athletics Club Heavy Throws Squad Leader.
</p>

<h5>Music</h5>
<p>
    I am a self-taught guitarist. I started playing in August 2020 with a Yamaha Pacifica 112V that I got for my 18th birthday. My second, and most recently bought, is an Ibanez RGA42HPT-LBM. I mostly listen to metal music - my favourite bands are Iron Maiden, Sabaton, and Megadeth. 
    It's hard to narrow down my top albums and songs to a concise list, but a few of my favourites are <i>Rust in Peace</i> by Megadeth, <i>Dance of Death</i> by Iron Maiden, and <i>Images and Words</i> by Dream Theatre. I have a couple of more unusual instruments in my possession, including a jaw harp and a harmonica.
</p>

<h5>Astronomy</h5>
<p>
    My interest in astronomy only really began when I came to Cambridge in 2021. Since then, I have been trained to use the University's 12- and 16-inch refractors. My favourite objects to observe are the Orion Nebula and Albireo. I was the Chair and Speaker Liaison of the CU Astronomical Society (23/24). My main job was organising the weekly talk series hosted throughout the year.
