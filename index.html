<h2>About me</h2>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p>
    I am a third-year (Part II) astrophysics undergraduate at the University of Cambridge. My main academic interests are in general relativity and cosmology. I have experience with programming in Python, and a touch of C++. I am currently taking courses in 
    <ul>
        <il>Structure and evolution of stars - Max Pettini</il>
        <il>Stellar dynamics and structure of galaxies - Wyn Evans and Cathie Clarke</il>
        <il>Relativity - Anastasia Fialkov</il>
        <il>Principles of quantum mechanics - Enrico Pajer</il>
        <il>Introduction to cosmology - Martin Haenhelt</il>
        <il>Statistical physics - Christopher Thomas</il>
        <il>Astrophysical fluid dynamics - Avishai Gilkis</il>
        <il>Topics in astrophysics - Cathie Clarke and Suhail Dhawan</il>
    </ul>
    In addition, I am taking two non-examinable courses in Introduction to astrophysics and Classical dynamics, lectured by Craig Mackay and David Skinner respectively.<br>
    In second year (Part IB), I took Physics A, Physics B, and Mathematics, and in first year (Part IA) I took Chemistry, Materials Science, Physics, and Mathematics B.

<h3>Extracurricular</h3>
<p>
    I am a keen sportsman, having played many throughout my life. My main sports are athletics (discus, hammer, shot put) and weightlifting. Additionally, I am a self-taught guitarist and amateur baker when I get the time. I mostly listen to metal music - my favourite bands are Iron Maiden, Sabaton, and Megadeth.
